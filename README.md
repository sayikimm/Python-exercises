# Python Practice Exercises

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate Python exercises I completed while learning programming concepts.  
The scripts cover functions, loops, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, and basic user interaction.

## Contents

- **hello.py** – Prints a personalized greeting based on user input.  
- **birth_year_finder.py** – Asks for name and age, calculates and prints birth year.  
- **area.py** – Interactive program to calculate the area of a circle, square, rectangle, or triangle.  
- **most_frequent.py** – Finds the most frequent item in a list; includes example test cases.  
- **most_frequent_word_counter.py** – Finds the most frequent word in a list of words.  
- **powers.py** – Calculates squares, cubes, and fourth powers of numbers, and their sum.  
- **shopping_list.py** – Adds and removes items from a shopping list based on user input.  
- **word_count.py** – Counts how many times each word occurs in a string.

## Notes
- Functions generally return values; the main script prints results to the console.  
- Some scripts are interactive and require user input.  
- These exercises were done to strengthen Python fundamentals and can be extended into mini-projects.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run any script with Python 3:

```bash
python filename.py
